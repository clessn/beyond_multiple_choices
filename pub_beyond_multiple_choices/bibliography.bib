The package and learning material focus on making it easy to use Ollama for annotating textual or imagine data with open-source models as well as use these models for document embedding. But users can use or extend rollama to do essentially anything else that is possible through OpenAI's API, yet more private, reproducible and for free.},

  abstract = {Likert scale is applied as one of the most fundamental and frequently used psychometric tools in educational and social sciences research. Simultaneously, it is also subjected to a lot of debates and controversies in regards with the analysis and inclusion of points on the scale. With this context, through reviewing the available literature and then clubbing the received information with coherent scientific thinking, this paper attempts to gradually build a construct around Likert scale. This analytical review begins with the necessity of psychometric tools like Likert scale andits variants and focuses on some convoluted issues like validity, reliability and analysis of the scale.},
