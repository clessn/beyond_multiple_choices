In 2007, Brainard argued that efforts to enhance teaching in STEM fields continue to encounter resistance. Critiques of STEM education may emphasize different aspects of the STEM undergraduate education problem. Nevertheless, each delivers one clear and consistent message: undergraduate education in STEM fields is not adequate to the task of preparing workers for our technologically driven economy or developing a scientifically literate citizenry capable of engaging in informed dialogue and decision making on important public policy issues. The report of the National Research Council's Committee on Undergraduate Science Education (1999) describes a nation divided into a technologically knowledgeable elite and a disadvantaged majority (National Research Council, 1999). The challenge facing educators in STEM is great. They need to ``teach large numbers of students with diverse backgrounds and interests'' (National Research Council, 2003, p. 2) and prepare them for a rapidly changing world where science and technology are increasingly important. As Nobel laureate Carl Wieman (2007) observed, ``We need a more scientifically literate populace to address the global challenges that humanity now faces and that only science can explain and possibly mitigate, such as global warming, as well as to make wise decisions, informed},

Based entirely on sparse operations,it provides highly efficient methods for compiling document-feature matrices and for manipulating these or using them in further quantitative analysis. Using C++ and multi-threading extensively, quanteda is also considerably faster and more efficient than other R and Python packages in processing large textual data. The package is designed for R users needing to apply natural language processing to texts,from documents to final analysis. Its capabilities match or exceed those provided in many end-user software applications, many of which are expensive and not open source. The package is therefore of great benefit to researchers, students, and other analysts with fewer financial resources. While using quanteda requires R programming knowledge, its API is designed to enable powerful, efficient analysis with a minimum of steps. By emphasizing consistent design, furthermore, quanteda lowers the barriers to learning and using NLP and quantitative text analysis even for proficient R programmers.},

I will describe the three components of topic modeling: (1) Topic modeling assumptions (2) Algorithms for computing with topic models (3) Applications of topic models In (1), I will describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which is one of the simplest topic models, and then describe a variety of ways that we can build on it. These include dynamic topic models, correlated topic models, supervised topic models, author-topic models, bursty topic models, Bayesian nonparametric topic models, and others. I will also discuss some of the fundamental statistical ideas that are used in building topic models, such as distributions on the simplex, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, and models of mixed-membership. In (2), I will review how we compute with topic models. I will describe approximate posterior inference for directed graphical models using both sampling and variational inference, and I will discuss the practical issues and pitfalls in developing these algorithms for topic models. Finally, I will describe some of our most recent work on building algorithms that can scale to millions of documents and documents arriving in a stream. In (3), I will discuss applications of topic models. These include applications to images, music, social networks, and other data in which we hope to uncover hidden patterns.

  abstract = {Topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), can be useful tools for the statistical analysis of document collections and other discrete data. The LDA model assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of topics, each of which is a distribution over the vocabulary. A limitation of LDA is the inability to model topic correlation even though, for example, a document about genetics is more likely to also be about disease than X-ray astronomy. This limitation stems from the use of the Dirichlet distribution to model the variability among the topic proportions. In this paper we develop the correlated topic model (CTM), where the topic proportions exhibit correlation via the logistic normal distribution [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 44 (1982) 139--177]. We derive a fast variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference in this model, which is complicated by the fact that the logistic normal is not conjugate to the multinomial. We apply the CTM to the articles from Science published from 1990--1999, a data set that comprises 57M words. The CTM gives a better fit of the data than LDA, and we demonstrate its use as an exploratory tool of large document collections.},

  abstract = {The large amount of text that is generated daily on the web through comments on social networks, blog posts and open-ended question surveys, among others, demonstrates that text data is used frequently, and therefore; its processing becomes a challenge for researchers. The topic modeling is one of the emerging techniques in text mining; it is based on the discovery of latent data and the search for relationships among text documents. In this paper, the objective of the research is to evaluate a generic methodology based on topic modeling and text network modeling, that allows researchers to gather valuable information from surveys that use open-ended questions. To achieve this, this methodology has been evaluated through the use of a case study in which the responses to a teacher self-assessment survey in an Ecuadorian university have been studied. The main contribution of the article is the inclusion of clustering algorithms in order to complement the results obtained when executing topic modeling. The proposed methodology is based on four phases: (a) Construction of a text database, (b) Text mining and topic modeling, (c) Topic network modeling and (d) The relevance of the identified topics. In previous works, it has been observed that the human interpretative contribution plays an important role in the process, especially in phases (a) and (d). For this reason, the visualization interfaces, such as graphs and dendograms, are of critical importance for researchers in order allow topic to efficiently analyze the results of the topic modeling. As a result of this case study, a compendium of the main strategies that teachers carry out in their classes with the aim of improving student retention is presented. In addition, the proposed methodology can be extended to the analysis of the unstructured textual information found in blogs, social networks, forums, etc.},

When a set of objects with their true classes is available, a supervised classifier can be trained and employed to decide if, for example, a new patient has cancer or not. The choice of performance measure is critical in deciding which supervised method to use in any particular classification problem. Different measures can lead to very different choices, so the measure should match the objectives. Many performance measures have been developed, and one of them is the F-measure, the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Originally proposed in information retrieval, the F-measure has gained increasing interest in the context of classification. However, the rationale underlying this measure appears weak, and unlike other measures, it does not have a representational meaning. The use of the harmonic mean also has little theoretical justification. The F-measure also stresses one class, which seems inappropriate for general classification problems. We provide a history of the F-measure and its use in computational disciplines, describe its properties, and discuss criticism about the F-Measure. We conclude with alternatives to the F-measure, and recommendations of how to use it effectively.},

However, analyzing open-ended responses using human coders is labor-intensive. Structural topic modeling (STM) is a text mining method that discover topics from textual data. We demonstrate the use of STM to analyze open-ended survey responses to understand how parents coped during the COVID-19 lock-down in Singapore. We administered online surveys to 199 parents in Singapore during the COVID-19 lock-down. To show a STM analysis, we demonstrated a workflow that includes steps in data preprocessing, model estimation, model selection, and model interpretation. An 18-topic model best fit the data based on model diagnostics and researchers' expertise. Prevalent coping methods described by respondents include ``Spousal Support,'' ``Routines/Schedules,'' and ``Managing Expectations.'' Topic prevalence for some topics varied with respondents' levels of parenting stress and whether parents were fathers or mothers. STM offers an efficient, valid, and replicable way to analyze textual data such as open-ended survey responses and case notes that can complement researchers' knowledge and skills. STM can be used as part of a multistage research process or to support other analyses such as clarifying quantitative findings and identifying preliminary themes from qualitative data.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/15228835.2022.2036301 .},

Methods Data from eight years of recently admitted students (2007--2014) were used to conduct a series of multiple linear regression analyses to assess relationships between prerequisite course GPA and eight different pharmacy school academic performance variables including: GPA in each of the first three years of the program, overall Y1-Y3 GPA, and GPA in pharmaceutical science, clinical science, clinical practice, and behavioral, social, and administrative (BSA) science courses. Demographic predictor variables including gender, mature status, and whether students attended ranked versus non-ranked universities were included as control variables. Results Analysis reveals that Biology and Biochemistry prerequisite GPA consistently predicts all eight academic performance variables while prerequisite English GPA was found to predict only clinical practice and BSA GPA. Being female and attending ranked universities were revealed as positively associated with most types of performance. Being classified as a mature student generally predicted lower academic performance. Conclusions The consistent relationship between biology-based prerequisites and academic performance warrants consideration for increasing their weight in admissions GPA calculations. The fact that the set of prerequisites and demographic variables are weaker predictors of clinical practice and BSA performance than pharmaceutical science performance provides empirical support for recent moves to include non-traditional admission criteria.},

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (``semantic structure'') in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising.},

This paper explores the Harrison School of Pharmacy's (HSOP) development and implementation of a week-long pharmacy camp designed to engage learners through active learning experiences to provide early exposure to the pharmacy profession. Methods The planning committee was formed in fall 2016, with the inaugural camp occurring summer 2017. A partnership with Auburn University Youth Programs allowed the committee to utilize existing university infrastructure and resources. Designed to expose campers to a variety of practice settings, the curriculum immersed participants in active learning experiences that allowed them to learn more about the clinical skills and knowledge needed for practice. To create diverse and learner-centric experiences, the planning committee recruited current second- and third-year student pharmacists to serve as counselors and peer instructors for all camp activities. Results Over two years, the camp hosted 40 campers representing nine states. Campers were predominantly female (65.3},

  abstract = {Open-ended questions are frequently used by survey researchers to measure public opinion. Some scholars, however, have doubts about how accurately these kinds of questions measure the views of the public. A chief concern is that the questions tap, in part, people's ability to articulate a response, not their underlying attitudes. This paper tests whether this concern is warranted. Using open-ended questions from the Center for Political Studies, I show that almost all people respond to open-ended questions. The few individuals who do not respond appear uninterested in the specific question posed, not unable to answer such questions in general. These findings should increase our confidence in work of scholars who have relied on open-ended questions. Different methods have been used by survey researchers to measure the political attitudes of the American public. One commonly used method is the open-ended question, which allows individuals to respond to the query in their own words. Many scholars contend that by allowing citizens to respond freely to the inquiry, the question is better able to measure their salient concerns than the close-ended format that forces people to choose among a fixed set of responses (see, for instance, RePass, 1971; Kelley, 1983; Wattenberg, 1984).1 While there are advantages to the open-ended format, criticisms have also been made against it. Among these is the belief that some citizens fail to JOHN G. GEER teaches at Arizona State University.

  abstract = {Politics and political conflict often occur in the written and spoken word. Scholars have long recognized this, but the massive costs of analyzing even moderately sized collections of texts have hindered their use in political science research. Here lies the promise of automated text analysis: it substantially reduces the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods---they are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and require extensive and problem-specific validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text methods to become a standard tool for political scientists, methodologists must contribute new methods and new methods of validation. Language is the medium for politics and political conflict. Candidates debate and state policy positions during a campaign. Once elected, representatives write and debate legislation. After laws are passed, bureaucrats solicit comments before they issue regulations. Nations regularly negotiate and then sign peace treaties, with language that signals the motivations and relative power of the countries involved. News reports document the day-to-day affairs of international relations that provide a detailed picture of conflict and cooperation. Individual candidates and political parties articulate their views through party platforms and manifestos. Terrorist groups even reveal their preferences and goals through recruiting materials, magazines, and public statements. These examples, and many others throughout political science, show that to understand what politics is about we need to know what political actors are saying and writing. Recognizing that language is central to the study of politics is not new. To the contrary, scholars of politics have long recognized that much of politics is expressed in words. But scholars have struggled when using texts to make inferences about politics. The primary problem is volume: there are simply too many political texts. Rarely are scholars able to manually read all the texts in even moderately sized corpora. And hiring coders to manually read all documents is still very expensive. The result is that},

Objective To identify Pharmacy and Pharm D undergraduates' attitudes and preferences toward different career choices and the factors that influence their career choice. Methods Across sectional study using the online survey web Question Pro was conducted on undergraduate Pharmacy and Pharm D students through the fall semester of the academic year 2019/2020 at four Colleges of Pharmacy in Jordan. In addition to demographics, the survey evaluated students' attitudes toward different career choices, career choices preferences and how different factors could influence this choice. Mann Whitney U test, Chi-square test, Friedman test, Wilcoxon and Multivariable linear regression were applied to analyze the data. Results A total of 354 undergraduate Pharmacy and Pharm D students completed the survey. Medical coverage and insurance was the most important variable affecting the students' career choice. The total sample favorite career choice was Academic and Research Centers (mean = 2.57), followed by Pharmaceutical companies (mean = 2.38), Hospital Pharmacy (mean = 2.36), Industry (mean = 1.79), and lastly Retail or Community Pharmacy (mean = 1.78). Males were significantly more tended to have a higher favorability scores for the Pharmaceutical Companies career choice than females. PharmD students had a significantly more favorable attitudes towards Hospital Pharmacy than Pharmacy students, who had a significantly more favorable attitude towards Retail or Community Pharmacy and Industry than Pharm D students. Conclusion The current study provides baseline data necessary to formulate strategies in the educational institutions by incorporating different programs and lectures to expand the capabilities of pharmacy students to meet the requirements of different market sectors and change their mindset about the different pharmacy sectors.},

Natural language processing techniques allow for relatively rapid and largely automated analysis of large collections of text data. Interpretation of the results and further investigations by subject matter experts can produce meaningful results. This explains the many commercial and academic applications of natural language processing to aviation safety reports. Relatively few published articles have, however, employed topic modeling, an approach that can identify latent structure within a corpus of documents. Topic modeling is more flexible and relies less on subject matter experts than alternative document categorization and clustering methods. It can, for example, uncover any number of topics hidden in a set of incident reports that have been, or would be, assigned to the same category when using labels and methods applied in earlier research. This article describes the application of structural topic modeling to Aviation Safety Reporting System data. The application identifies known issues. The method also reveals previously unreported connections. Sample results reported here highlight fuel pump, tank, and landing gear issues and the relative insignificance of smoke and fire issues for private aircraft. The results also reveal the prominence of the Quiet Bridge Visual and Tip Toe Visual approach paths at San Francisco International Airport in safety incident reports. These results would, ideally, be verified by subject matter experts before being used to set priorities when planning future safety studies.},

By inducing global knowledge indirectly from local co-occurrence data in a large body of representative text, LSA acquired knowledge about the full vocabulary of English at a comparable rate to schoolchildren. LSA uses no prior linguistic or perceptual similarity knowledge; it is based solely on a general mathematical learning method that achieves powerful inductive effects by extracting the right number of dimensions (e.g., 300) to represent objects and contexts.

Yet, questions regarding reliability and validity of the approach have received little attention thus far. In applying LDA to textual data, researchers need to tackle at least four major challenges that affect these criteria: (a) appropriate pre-processing of the text collection; (b) adequate selection of model parameters, including the number of topics to be generated; (c) evaluation of the model's reliability; and (d) the process of validly interpreting the resulting topics. We review the research literature dealing with these questions and propose a methodology that approaches these challenges. Our overall goal is to make LDA topic modeling more accessible to communication researchers and to ensure compliance with disciplinary standards. Consequently, we develop a brief hands-on user guide for applying LDA topic modeling. We demonstrate the value of our approach with empirical data from an ongo...},

The purpose of this study was to gather the background, functions, and skills of pharmacists working in the role of a medical information specialist (MIS) and their preparation for the role through their pharmacy education. Methods An electronic survey was sent to medical information departments and obtained information on educational background, prior job experience, and skills required for the MIS role. The survey also asked for suggestions on how pharmacy schools can prepare students for this role. Results The survey was sent to 40 medical information departments from September to December 2017 and a total of 33 pharmacists responded. Approximately half of the responders did not complete post graduate training. The role of a MIS includes answering medical information questions and collecting adverse events and product complaints. Skills rated as important to the role as a MIS were communication skills, medical writing, and literature evaluation. Four pharmacists thought their pharmacy education definitely prepared them for role in medical information. The pharmacists suggested pharmacy curriculum focus more on drug information skills, structure of the pharmaceutical industry, and providing opportunities to improve emotional intelligence and critical thinking. Conclusion The information collected in this survey can provide valuable insight for students interested in this career path. In addition, pharmacy schools may include more opportunities during the didactic and experiential years to help prepare students for this alternate career path.},

Twenty different datasets were used to assess the performances of the classification metrics. Accuracy and Area Under the Curve are the two metrics that consistently gave a classification result given each dataset used in the study. Although accuracy appears to be marginally better that AUC, it was discovered that in some cases where sensitivity is zero, accuracy yielded a high correct classification result. This goes further to implying that prior to choosing accuracy as a preferred metric for classification, investigation should be carried out to find out what sensitivity and specificity are. Where there are high values for sensitivity and specificity, the study shows that a choice of accuracy as a preferred classification metric leads to a high percentage of correct classification result.},

Some activities utilized by educators require large amounts of technological expertise, while others involve minimal use of technology. The incorporation of technology can create highly immersive experiences for learners; however, there are barriers (e.g., financial and technology prowess) to implementation compared to simpler designs. One area of GBL that is not well defined in the literature is how to adequately assess student learning outcomes. Most current studies describe subjective attitudes and confidence or assess content knowledge through objective pre- and post-tests. In the future, more defined and connected methods for assessment-such as active demonstrations within the game-will be needed to better incorporate GBL into pharmacy curricula.

Thought leaders representing a variety of industries were surveyed regarding their perspectives on the future of pharmacy practice, pharmaceutical science disciplines, and pharmacy education in seven domains. From 46 completed surveys, top challenges/threats were barriers that limit clinical practice opportunities, excessive supply of pharmacists, and high drug costs. Major changes in the drug distribution system, automation/robotics, and new therapeutic approaches were identified as the top technological disrupters. Key drivers of pharmacy education included the primary care provider shortage, growing use of technology and data, and rising drug costs. The most significant sources of job growth outside of retail and hospital settings were managed care organizations, technology/biotech/pharmaceutical companies, and ambulatory care practices. Needs in the industry included clinical management of complex patients, leadership and management, pharmaceutical scientists, and implementation science. Knowledge gaps were pharmacists not recognizing their value on the health care team, preparation to embrace and lead change, and expertise in data science and analytics. Pharmacy schools will need to address several disruptive trends to future-proof their curricula, including expanding patient management skills, leadership and management training, technology, and data analytics.},

The models are fitted and evaluated on a set of real-world open-ended responses provided by a market research company. Multiple components such as topic coherence and document classification are quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated to appraise whether topic models can replace human coding.

Summary Cannabis regulation and use have evolved over the centuries and are becoming more widely accepted, with over two-thirds of states in the United States having an approved cannabis program. However, changing policy and a paucity of controlled clinical trials has led to questions on the safety and effectiveness of cannabinoid therapies. Although there are conditions for which cannabinoids may be helpful, potential contraindications, adverse effects, and drug-drug interactions should be taken into account. Conclusion Pharmacists are in a unique position based on their accessibility, knowledge, and skills to guide product selection, dosing, and discuss drug interactions and adverse effects to educate patients on safe cannabis use, whether it be delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, or a combination thereof. Pharmacists and pharmacy organizations, moreover, should advocate for an integral role in the medical cannabis movement to ensure patient safety and evaluate cannabinoid pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions, safety, and efficacy through rigorous investigations.},

Last year, we proposed an alternative dictionary-based approach for the automated content analysis of texts (see Albaugh et al. 2013). We designed a first version of an English and a Dutch CAP-dictionary, and we validated the results of the codings against human coded documents. Although the results were not perfect yet -- with respect to certain topic codes our dictionaries could certainly be improved -- we showed that dictionaries may produce reliable, valid and comparable measures of policy and media agendas. This year, we take the next step by doing three things. First, we further develop the Dutch and English dictionaries and try to replicate human coding results by making the dictionary assign single topic codes to single items. Second, we compare the dictionaries not only with human coded texts; we also validate them in a substantive manner. We expect individual Members of Parliament (MPs) to act most upon issues that they prioritize. Concretely, we test this by comparing MPs' dictionary-coded attention for issues with their committee membership. Third, we show that valuable insights can be gained from using the dictionaries in practice.},

We gauge response quality by the amount and type of information contained in responses as well as response time and item nonresponse. The results indicate that increasing the size of the answer box has little effect on early responders to the survey but substantially improved response quality among late responders. Including any sort of explanation or introduction that made response quality and length salient also improved response quality for both early and late responders.

A measure based on this procedure produces far more prototypical partisans, those positive toward one party and negative toward the other, than do other studies. Positive-negatives did decline after 1964 with the infusion of young people into the electorate, the increase in independents, and the political traumas of the 1960s and 1970s, but by 1984 most Americans were positivenegatives. This reversal suggests the resiliency of electoral partisanship.},

Information was obtained from the university's data system and analyzed. Persistence was defined as the student continuing at the university from the fall to spring academic terms. Retention was defined as the student being enrolled at the university during a subsequent fall term. Progression was determined by whether the student had successfully completed the pre-pharmacy curriculum and began pharmacy school within two or three years of initial enrollment in the pre-pharmacy program. {\textexclamdown}b{\textquestiondown}Results.{\textexclamdown}/b{\textquestiondown} Despite having admissions characteristics comparable to other pre-pharmacy students, students who participated in the LLC demonstrated significantly higher grade-point averages and retention than their peers who did not participate. {\textexclamdown}b{\textquestiondown}Conclusion.{\textexclamdown}/b{\textquestiondown} Living learning community programs may be a valuable contributor to pre-pharmacy student success in terms of students' persistence, retention, and progression in a pre-pharmacy program.},

We present a comprehensive survey of deep neural network architectures for NER, and contrast them with previous approaches to NER based on feature engineering and other supervised or semi-supervised learning algorithms. Our results highlight the improvements achieved by neural networks, and show how incorporating some of the lessons learned from past work on feature-based NER systems can yield further improvements.},

  abstract = {Uncovering the topics within short texts, such as tweets and instant messages, has become an important task for many content analysis applications. However, directly applying conventional topic models (e.g. LDA and PLSA) on such short texts may not work well. The fundamental reason lies in that conventional topic models implicitly capture the document-level word co-occurrence patterns to reveal topics, and thus suffer from the severe data sparsity in short documents. In this paper, we propose a novel way for modeling topics in short texts, referred as biterm topic model (BTM). Specifically, in BTM we learn the topics by directly modeling the generation of word co-occurrence patterns (i.e. biterms) in the whole corpus. The major advantages of BTM are that 1) BTM explicitly models the word co-occurrence patterns to enhance the topic learning; and 2) BTM uses the aggregated patterns in the whole corpus for learning topics to solve the problem of sparse word co-occurrence patterns at document-level. We carry out extensive experiments on real-world short text collections. The results demonstrate that our approach can discover more prominent and coherent topics, and significantly outperform baseline methods on several evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we find that BTM can outperform LDA even on normal texts, showing the potential generality and wider usage of the new topic model.},

  abstract = {This article investigates item nonresponse in open-ended survey questions because such item nonresponse is much higher than in closed questions. The difference is a result of the higher cognitive burden placed on the respondent. To study item nonresponse, we manipulate different questionnaire design characteristics, such as the size of the answer box and the inclusion of motivation texts, as well as respondent-specific characteristics, in a randomized web experiment using a student sample. The results show that a motivation text increases the frequency of responses to open-ended questions for both small and large answer boxes. However, large answer boxes earn higher item nonresponse than small answer boxes regardless of the usage of a motivation text. In addition, gender and the respondent's field of study affected the answering of open-ended questions; being a woman or studying social sciences increased the frequency of a response. As the major finding and in contrast to previous findings, our results indicate that particularly large answer boxes should be avoided, because they reduce respondents' willingness to respond.},

  abstract = {The short text has been the prevalent format for information of Internet, especially with the development of online social media. Although sophisticated signals delivered by the short text make it a promising source for topic modeling, its extreme sparsity and imbalance bring unprecedented challenges to conventional topic models like LDA and its variants. Aiming at presenting a simple but general solution for topic modeling in short texts, we present a word co-occurrence network-based model named WNTM to tackle the sparsity and imbalance simultaneously. Different from previous approaches, WNTM models the distribution over topics for each word instead of learning topics for each document, which successfully enhances the semantic density of data space without importing too much time or space complexity. Meanwhile, the rich contextual information preserved in the word---word space also guarantees its sensitivity in identifying rare topics with convincing quality. Furthermore, employing the same Gibbs sampling as LDA makes WNTM easily to be extended to various application scenarios. Extensive validations on both short and normal texts testify the outperformance of WNTM as compared to baseline methods. And we also demonstrate its potential in precisely discovering newly emerging topics or unexpected events in Weibo at pretty early stages.},
